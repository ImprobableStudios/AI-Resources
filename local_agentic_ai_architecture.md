### 2.2 Architecture Principles

#### 2.2.1 Hierarchical Design
- **Single Point of Control**: Primary coordinating agent manages all user interactions
- **Specialized Sub-Agents**: Domain-specific agents with focused capabilities and limited context
- **Intelligent Routing**: Dynamic delegation based on request analysis and agent capabilities

#### 2.2.2 Modular Components
- **Containerized Services**: All components except Ollama run in Docker containers
- **Loose Coupling**: Components communicate via well-defined APIs and message queues
- **Pluggable Architecture**: Easy addition/removal of agents and services

#### 2.2.3 Local-First Approach
- **Data Sovereignty**: All processing and storage occurs locally
- **Minimal External Dependencies**: Only essential external services (weather, news APIs)
- **Offline Capability**: Core functionality available without internet connectivity

- **Request Analysis**: Understanding user intent and context
- **Agent Selection**: Choosing appropriate sub-agents for tasks
- **Response Synthesis**: Combining sub-agent outputs into coherent responses
- **Context Management**: Maintaining conversation state and history
- **Quality Control**: Validating and refining responses

#### 4.1.2 Decision Matrix
```
Request Type          → Primary Agent → Sub-Agent(s)
Technical Question    → Analysis      → Technical Docs Agent
Business Query        → Analysis      → Business Knowledge Agent
Complex Task          → Decomposition → Task-Master Agent
Tool Operation        → Routing       → Tools Agent
Multi-Domain          → Orchestration → Multiple Agents
```

#### 4.1.3 Model Configuration
- **Primary Model**: llama4:scout (reasoning and coordination)
- **Context Window**: 32K tokens for conversation history
- **Temperature**: 0.3 for consistent decision-making
- **System Prompt**: Comprehensive instructions for agent coordination

#### 4.1.4 Example System Prompt
```
You are the Primary Coordinating Agent in a hierarchical AI system. Your role is to analyze user requests, route them to appropriate specialized agents, and synthesize their responses into coherent, helpful answers.

CORE RESPONSIBILITIES:
1. Analyze incoming requests to understand intent, complexity, and required expertise
2. Select and delegate to appropriate sub-agents based on request characteristics
3. Synthesize multiple agent responses into unified, coherent answers
4. Maintain conversation context and ensure response quality
5. Handle error cases and provide fallback responses when sub-agents fail

AVAILABLE SUB-AGENTS:
- technical_docs_agent: Technical documentation, API references, code examples
- business_knowledge_agent: Company policies, procedures, business processes
- task_master_agent: Complex task decomposition and workflow planning
- tools_agent: File operations, database queries, web APIs, external integrations
- session_rag_agent: Temporary session-specific knowledge and uploaded documents

ROUTING DECISION PROCESS:
1. Classify request type (technical, business, task-oriented, tool-based, multi-domain)
2. Assess complexity level (simple lookup, complex analysis, multi-step task)
3. Determine required expertise and select appropriate agent(s)
4. Format delegation message with clear instructions and context
5. Process agent responses and synthesize final answer

RESPONSE FORMAT:
- Always provide complete, helpful responses
- Cite sources when information comes from knowledge bases
- Indicate confidence levels for uncertain information
- Suggest follow-up questions when appropriate
- Maintain professional, helpful tone

ERROR HANDLING:
- If sub-agent fails, attempt alternative approaches
- Provide partial answers when complete information unavailable
- Clearly communicate limitations and uncertainties
- Suggest manual verification for critical information
```

#### 4.1.5 Example User Interactions

**Example 1: Technical Query Routing**
```
User Input: "How do I implement OAuth2 authentication in our Node.js API?"

Primary Agent Analysis:
- Request Type: Technical documentation query
- Complexity: Medium (requires specific implementation details)
- Required Agent: technical_docs_agent
- Context: Node.js, OAuth2, API development

Delegation Message to technical_docs_agent:
{
  "query": "OAuth2 authentication implementation in Node.js API",
  "context": "User needs implementation guidance for OAuth2 in Node.js API",
  "focus_areas": ["authentication", "Node.js", "OAuth2", "API security"],
  "response_format": "step-by-step implementation guide with code examples"
}
```

**Example 2: Complex Task Routing**
```
User Input: "I need to migrate our customer database to a new schema, update all related APIs, and notify the development team about the changes."

Primary Agent Analysis:
- Request Type: Multi-step complex task
- Complexity: High (requires coordination of multiple activities)
- Required Agent: task_master_agent
- Context: Database migration, API updates, team communication

Delegation Message to task_master_agent:
{
  "task": "Database migration with API updates and team notification",
  "components": [
    "database schema migration",
    "API endpoint updates", 
    "team communication and documentation"
  ],
  "constraints": {
    "minimize_downtime": true,
    "maintain_data_integrity": true,
    "coordinate_with_team": true
  }
}
```

#### 4.1.6 Example Agent Responses

**Example 1: Synthesized Technical Response**
```
Based on our technical documentation, here's how to implement OAuth2 authentication in your Node.js API:

## Implementation Steps

1. **Install Required Dependencies**
   \```bash
   npm install passport passport-oauth2 express-session
   \```

2. **Configure OAuth2 Strategy**
   \```javascript
   const OAuth2Strategy = require('passport-oauth2');
   
   passport.use(new OAuth2Strategy({
     authorizationURL: 'https://provider.com/oauth2/authorize',
     tokenURL: 'https://provider.com/oauth2/token',
     clientID: process.env.CLIENT_ID,
     clientSecret: process.env.CLIENT_SECRET,
     callbackURL: '/auth/callback'
   }, (accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) => {
     // Handle user authentication
     return done(null, profile);
   }));
   \```

3. **Set Up Routes**
   \```javascript
   app.get('/auth', passport.authenticate('oauth2'));
   app.get('/auth/callback', 
     passport.authenticate('oauth2', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
     (req, res) => res.redirect('/dashboard')
   );
   \```

**Security Considerations:**
- Store client secrets in environment variables
- Implement proper session management
- Validate tokens on each request
- Use HTTPS in production

## Migration Plan Overview

### Phase 1: Preparation (Estimated: 2-3 days)
1. **Schema Analysis & Design**
   - Review current database structure
   - Design new schema with migration mapping
   - Create rollback procedures

2. **API Impact Assessment**
   - Identify affected endpoints
   - Plan API versioning strategy
   - Prepare backward compatibility layer

### Phase 2: Implementation (Estimated: 1-2 days)
1. **Database Migration**
   - Create migration scripts
   - Set up staging environment testing
   - Schedule maintenance window

2. **API Updates**
   - Update data access layers
   - Modify endpoint responses
   - Update API documentation

### Phase 3: Communication & Deployment (Estimated: 1 day)
1. **Team Notification**
   - Send migration timeline to development team
   - Update technical documentation
   - Schedule team briefing session

2. **Deployment & Monitoring**
   - Execute migration during low-traffic period
   - Monitor system performance
   - Validate data integrity

**Risk Mitigation:**

\```bash
npm install passport passport-oauth2 express-session connect-redis
npm install --save-dev @types/passport @types/express-session
\```

### 2. Configure OAuth2 Strategy
\```javascript
// config/oauth.js
const OAuth2Strategy = require('passport-oauth2');
const passport = require('passport');

passport.use('oauth2', new OAuth2Strategy({
  authorizationURL: process.env.OAUTH2_AUTH_URL,
  tokenURL: process.env.OAUTH2_TOKEN_URL,
  clientID: process.env.OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID,
  clientSecret: process.env.OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET,
  callbackURL: process.env.OAUTH2_CALLBACK_URL,
  scope: ['read', 'write']
}, async (accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) => {
  try {
    // Validate token and fetch user profile
    const user = await validateAndCreateUser(profile, accessToken);
    return done(null, user);
  } catch (error) {
    return done(error, null);
  }
}));
\```

### 3. Set Up Authentication Routes
\```javascript
// routes/auth.js
const express = require('express');
const passport = require('passport');
const router = express.Router();

// Initiate OAuth2 flow
router.get('/oauth2', passport.authenticate('oauth2'));

// Handle OAuth2 callback
router.get('/oauth2/callback',
  passport.authenticate('oauth2', { 
    failureRedirect: '/login?error=auth_failed',
    session: true 
  }),
  (req, res) => {
    // Successful authentication
    res.redirect('/dashboard');
  }
);

// Logout endpoint
router.post('/logout', (req, res) => {
  req.logout((err) => {
    if (err) return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Logout failed' });
    res.json({ message: 'Logged out successfully' });
  });
});

module.exports = router;
\```

### 4. Implement Token Validation Middleware

  try {
    const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
    if (!token) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'No token provided' });
    }

    // Validate token with OAuth2 provider
    const isValid = await verifyTokenWithProvider(token);
    if (!isValid) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
    }

    req.user = await getUserFromToken(token);
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Token validation failed' });
  }
};

module.exports = { validateToken };
\```

## Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
\```bash
# .env
OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
OAUTH2_AUTH_URL=https://provider.com/oauth2/authorize
OAUTH2_TOKEN_URL=https://provider.com/oauth2/token
OAUTH2_CALLBACK_URL=https://yourapp.com/auth/oauth2/callback
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
\```

### Production Security Checklist
- ✅ Use HTTPS for all OAuth2 endpoints
- ✅ Implement CSRF protection
- ✅ Set secure session cookies
- ✅ Validate redirect URIs
- ✅ Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints
- ✅ Log authentication events for monitoring

## Testing
\```javascript
// tests/auth.test.js
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../app');

describe('OAuth2 Authentication', () => {
  test('should redirect to OAuth2 provider', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .get('/auth/oauth2')
      .expect(302);
    
    expect(response.headers.location).toContain('oauth2/authorize');
  });

  test('should handle callback with valid code', async () => {
    // Mock OAuth2 provider response
    // Test callback handling
  });
});
\```

# Contract Review Guidelines

**⚠️ Legal Disclaimer:** This information is for general guidance only and does not constitute legal advice. Always consult with qualified legal counsel for specific contract matters.

## Standard Contract Review Process

Based on our legal knowledge base, here's the general approach for contract review:

### 1. Initial Assessment
- **Contract Type:** Identify the nature of the agreement (service, employment, NDA, etc.)
- **Parties:** Verify all parties are properly identified and have authority to contract
- **Scope:** Ensure the scope of work/services is clearly defined

### 2. Key Terms Review
- **Payment Terms:** Amount, schedule, and payment conditions
- **Deliverables:** Specific outcomes, timelines, and acceptance criteria
- **Liability:** Limitation of liability and indemnification clauses
- **Termination:** Conditions for contract termination and notice requirements

### 3. Risk Assessment
- **Compliance Requirements:** Regulatory and industry-specific obligations
- **Intellectual Property:** Ownership and usage rights
- **Confidentiality:** Protection of sensitive information
- **Dispute Resolution:** Arbitration, mediation, or court jurisdiction

## Red Flags Requiring Legal Review

🚨 **Immediate Legal Consultation Required:**
- Unlimited liability exposure
- Unusual indemnification requirements
- Complex intellectual property assignments
- International jurisdiction issues
- Regulatory compliance uncertainties

## Standard Contract Templates

Our legal knowledge base includes templates for:
- **Service Agreements** (Template: LEGAL-SA-001)
- **Non-Disclosure Agreements** (Template: LEGAL-NDA-002)
- **Employment Contracts** (Template: LEGAL-EMP-003)
- **Vendor Agreements** (Template: LEGAL-VA-004)

**Sources:**
- Corporate Legal Guidelines (Updated: 2025-06-15)
- Contract Template Library (Version: 2025.2)
- Compliance Requirements Database (Updated: 2025-07-01)

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Use appropriate template as starting point
2. Customize terms based on specific requirements
3. **Schedule legal review before execution**
4. Ensure all parties have proper signing authority

**Professional Consultation Required:** For contracts over $50,000, international agreements, or complex liability arrangements, qualified legal counsel review is mandatory per company policy.

# Database Migration Analysis Report

## Operation Summary
**Task**: Customer database schema analysis for migration planning
**Database**: production_customers (PostgreSQL 13.x)
**Execution Time**: 2.3 seconds
**Status**: ✅ Completed Successfully

## Schema Analysis Results

### Table Structure Overview
\```sql
-- Current schema statistics
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    n_tup_ins as total_inserts,
    n_tup_upd as total_updates,
    n_tup_del as total_deletes,
    n_live_tup as live_rows,
    n_dead_tup as dead_rows
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'customer_data';
\```

**Results:**
| Table Name | Live Rows | Data Size | Last Vacuum | Indexes |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| customers | 2,547,832 | 1.2 GB | 2025-07-28 | 8 |
| customer_addresses | 3,891,245 | 890 MB | 2025-07-28 | 5 |
| customer_preferences | 2,547,832 | 456 MB | 2025-07-27 | 3 |
| customer_orders | 15,234,567 | 4.8 GB | 2025-07-29 | 12 |

### Data Type Analysis
\```sql
-- Column data types and constraints
SELECT 
    table_name,
    column_name,
    data_type,
    is_nullable,
    column_default,
    character_maximum_length
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'customer_data'
ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;
\```

**Key Findings:**
- **Legacy Data Types**: 15 columns using deprecated `text` type
- **Missing Constraints**: 8 tables lack proper foreign key constraints
- **Index Optimization**: 23 unused indexes consuming 340 MB
- **Data Consistency**: 0.02% of records have referential integrity issues

### Migration Complexity Assessment

#### High-Risk Areas
1. **Large Tables**: customer_orders (15M+ rows) requires careful migration strategy
2. **Data Dependencies**: Complex foreign key relationships across 12 tables
3. **Active Connections**: Average 45 concurrent connections during business hours

#### Recommended Migration Strategy
\```sql
-- Suggested migration phases
-- Phase 1: Schema preparation (estimated 2 hours)
CREATE SCHEMA customer_data_v2;
-- Create new tables with optimized structure

-- Phase 2: Data migration (estimated 4-6 hours)
-- Use pg_dump/pg_restore with parallel processing
-- Migrate in order: customers -> addresses -> preferences -> orders

-- Phase 3: Index rebuilding (estimated 1-2 hours)
-- Rebuild indexes with optimized parameters
-- Update table statistics
\```
